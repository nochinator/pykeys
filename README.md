HELLO WORLD!

This is my first project. It is going to be a app that allows you to set up custom hotkeys.
Currently it is underdevelopment and not ready for release, but when it does release it will be able to open apps and focus apps that are already open.
Those will be the first capabilitys, however I do not want that to be the only features in the future.

If you would like, the best way you can is by helping me get that apps to focus, below is a check list of features that are done and features that need implementing.

I. allow setting custom hotkeys ✔

II. opening an app if it is not already open ✔

III. focusing (bringing to front) an app if it is already open /

  1. check if app is open ✔
  
  2. if its open focus it ✔

  3. get the pid of the app to be focused ✔
  
  4. actualy focus it /

IV. saving hotkey /
  
  1. a save format ✔
  
  2. writing the data to disk in a file ✔
  
  3. saving multiple hotkeys ✔
  
  4. removing hotkeys ✔
